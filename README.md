# 🚀 Anti-Spoof Smart Attendance System

## 🔍 Project Overview

The **Anti-Spoof Smart Attendance System** is an advanced AI-powered solution designed to automate attendance management with high security and precision. Unlike traditional systems that are vulnerable to spoofing attempts (e.g., photos or videos), this system combines **face recognition**, **anti-spoofing validation**, **real-time voice feedback**, and **automated email reporting**—making it ideal for institutions and enterprises demanding secure and seamless attendance tracking.

## 🧠 Key Features

- ✅ **AI-based Face Recognition**  
  Accurately identifies individuals in real-time using `DeepFace` and `dlib` for high-precision authentication.

- 🧪 **Anti-Spoofing Mechanism**  
  Prevents fake attendance attempts using liveness detection via facial landmarks and motion cues.

- 🔊 **Voice Feedback System**  
  Uses `pyttsx3` for text-to-speech confirmation—giving users audible confirmation of attendance status.

- 📧 **Automated Email Reporting**  
  Sends attendance logs to administrators at predefined intervals using `smtplib`.

- 🗃️ **Database-Driven Record Management**  
  Utilizes `SQLite` for secure and structured storage of user profiles and attendance history.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries & Tools:** DeepFace, OpenCV, Dlib, pyttsx3, SQLite, smtplib  
- **Others:** PIL, NumPy, datetime, os
